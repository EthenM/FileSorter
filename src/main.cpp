 * The file will be inputted during program execution, not from the command line.
 * 
 * This will then take the root directory, and find all the files within the directory.
 * 
 * It will then ask for the time span for the directories (either years or months)
 * 
 * Once the files have been found, it will move/copy them over to files split based on how the user
 * wishes (by year or month)
